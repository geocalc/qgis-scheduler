/*
    Database for the QGIS projects.
    Stores the project name and the list of processes working on that project.
    Also stores the path of the qgis configuration file for the processes and
    its inotify watch descriptor. And the compiled regular expression
    to recognize the project by its query string.
    Starts a separate thread to check its configuration file and then reload or
    restart the processes.
