# This is the configuration file for qgis-schedulerd

# Here we have the global section. Items in here are valid for all projects.
# Some of them can be further specified in each project section. I.e. if you
# like to start a different fcgi process in a special project, or you have
# special arguments to the fcgi process.

# Specify on which connections to listen to.
# (default:*)
# Accept connections from everywhere
# listen=*
# Accept connections from localhost only
# listen=localhost
# Accept connections from this client only
# listen=192.168.10.0

# Network port to listen to.
# (default: 10177)
# port=10177

# Minimum amount of idle fcgi processes.
# During a network connection the amount of idle processes is tested against
# this value. In case a new process is started.
# Note the threshold between min_proc and max_proc should be high enough, else
# you put unnecessary load on your server.
# (default: 1)
# min_proc=1

# Maximum amount of idle fcgi processes.
# If there are too many idle fcgi processes they get the SIGTERM or SIGKILL
# signal.
# Note the threshold between min_proc and max_proc should be high enough, else
# you put unnecessary load on your server.
# (default: 20)
# max_proc=20

# Logfile, where to put information during the service.
# (default: none)
# logfile=/var/log/qgis-scheduler/qgis-scheduler.log

# Write a file containing the process id.
# This is omitted, if no file is specified.
# (default: none)
# pidfile=/var/run/qgis-schedulerd.pid

# Drop privileges after startup.
# The users are specified by name, not by number
# (default: no change user id )
# chuser=

# Change root directory to chroot during startup.
# (default: no change root)
# chroot=

# Process to start.
# Note if you don't specify this the server will exit with an error code

# (default:none)
# not implemented!

# specific settings.

# note: in case of using qgis_mapserv cwd should be set to the path of
# wms_metadata.xml
# (default: '/')
cwd=/usr/lib/cgi-bin

# set the timeout to wait for child processes to answer a request. If the
# timeout occures we belive that the process hangs and try to kill it.
# The default setting for this is quite long for cases where dozends of
# processes are started on a busy server.
# Setting in seconds.
# (default: 270 sec)
# proc_read_timeout=270

# set the timeout to wait for child processes to end after receiving SIGTERM.
# If the timeout occures we belive that the process hangs and try to kill it.
# Setting in seconds.
# (default: 10 sec)
# proc_term_timeout=10

# if the program ends with an exit value of failure (i.e. != 0)
# this setting may abort the program to dump a core file.
