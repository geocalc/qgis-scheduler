/* The livecycle of a process runs through these three lists.
 * First the process gets initialized. In this list the process can not do
 * useful work, so the processes in that list are not taken to answer web
 * requests. The process may exit this list after the initialization phase with
 * the state idle or by crashing. All existing (i.e. idle) processes exit this
 * list to the active list.
 *
 * The second list (active list) is the work list. Processes in here answer
 * requests from the web server, or they idle around. The process in here may
 * exit this list with a request to shut down or by crashing. All existing
 * (i.e. not killed) processes exit this list to the shutdown list.
 *
 * The third list is the shutdown list. In this list the processes wont accept
 * further work from the webserver, but the may end their current work if it is
 * a long running task. As soon as the processes in this list get idle, they
 * receive a shutdown signal (SIGTERM or SIGKILL).
 *
 * This enumeration describes the lists.
