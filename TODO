+ delete all environment variables before starting a new child process

+ hand over those URLs which can not be recognized by the scan settings to a set of programs handling global requests
+ hold a general process group or general project separate of the configured projects to handle requests which do not fit into all other projects

+ parse the configuration file at program start and warn about incorrect settings (e.g. empty scan_param= or empty scan_regex= or errors compiling regular expression).
  remove the project from the project list on any error.

+ assign path of the config file by autotools parameter

+ reload the configuration with SIGHUP. Eventually stop and start the child processes. Eventually track for changes and react on the changes only??

+ test for existence of config path "cwd" and exit with error (global config) or write error to log file (project config)

+ create a whole fcgi session from input data in one function call, so we do not care about 16bit message sizes

+ add include= key to config file, to include a whole subdirectory of files. Better administration when adding projects to the configuration

+ disable initialization if no init data is configured

+ be able to select file logging or syslog logging in config file

+ write statistics to logfile if sigusr1 is received

+ write a man page

+ have a look at the file descriptor limit during startup and write a warning if we get close to soft or hard limits

+ if no free idle process is available for the work wait some timeout if a process gets available.
+ in meantime start a new process.
