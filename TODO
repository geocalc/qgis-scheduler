+ create a list of projects containing a list of processes, a compiled regular expression, etc.

+ delete all environment variables before starting a new child process

+ hand over those URLs which can not be recognized by the scan settings to a set of programs handling global requests

+ parse the configuration file at program start and warn about incorrect settings (e.g. empty scan_param= or empty scan_regex= or errors compiling regular expression).
  remove the project from the project list on any error.

+ create a log file and reassign the stdout and stderr channel to the log file.

+ setup a log message module. This adds informations about the pid and more to the log string

+ use autotools for the build process

+ assign path of the config file by autotools parameter

+ initialize the qgis program with a query string

+ test for execution times. warn in log file if execution time exceeds a limit

+ reload the configuration with SIGHUP. Eventually stop and start the child processes. Eventually track for changes and react on the changes only??

+ track qgis config file for changes and restart the child processes in case

+ test for existence of config path "cwd" and exit with error (global config) or write error to log file (project config)

+ hold a general process group or general project separate of the configured projects to handle requests which do not fit into all other projects

+ create a whole fcgi session from input data in one function call, so we do not care about 16bit message sizes

+ add include= key to config file, to include a whole subdirectory of files. Better administration when adding projects to the configuration
