+ delete all environment variables before starting a new child process

+ hand over those URLs which can not be recognized by the scan settings to a set of programs handling global requests

+ parse the configuration file at program start and warn about incorrect settings (e.g. empty scan_param= or empty scan_regex= or errors compiling regular expression).
  remove the project from the project list on any error.

+ use autotools for the build process

+ assign path of the config file by autotools parameter

+ test for execution times. warn in log file if execution time exceeds a limit

+ reload the configuration with SIGHUP. Eventually stop and start the child processes. Eventually track for changes and react on the changes only??

+ track qgis config file for changes and restart the child processes in case

+ test for existence of config path "cwd" and exit with error (global config) or write error to log file (project config)

+ hold a general process group or general project separate of the configured projects to handle requests which do not fit into all other projects

+ create a whole fcgi session from input data in one function call, so we do not care about 16bit message sizes

+ add include= key to config file, to include a whole subdirectory of files. Better administration when adding projects to the configuration

+ disable initialization if no init data is configured

+ during shutdown make a poll frequency of 1 second (instead of 10) to check for child procs already gone

+ be able to select file logging or syslog logging in config file

+ write statistics to logfile if sigusr1 is received

+ NEED glibc >= 2.21 . We get SEGFAULT because fork() and dprintf() won't go well, see https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12847
